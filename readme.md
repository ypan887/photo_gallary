## Introduction

This is my first reactjs project following MaterLiu's tutorial. The original tutorila was old, so I tried to rewrote most of the code in es6 and react 0.15. 

I also expaneded the project with a rails backend using the react on rails gem. The new project allows user to upload cropped image to the app. You can find its demo here, and its code here

### Dependency Version
