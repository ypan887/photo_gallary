## Introduction

This is a re-rewrite of MaterLiu's reactjs tutorial project. The original repo was in es5 and some dependency are outdated, so I tried to rewrote the repo code in es6 and react 15.0.0. 

I also expended the project with a rails backend using the react on rails gem. The new project allows user to upload cropped image asynchronously. You can find its demo [here](https://photo-gallery-react.herokuapp.com/), and its code [here](https://github.com/ypan887/photo_gallery_react_on_rails)

### Dependency Version That I have
node 6.3.1
npm 3.10.5
react 15.0.0

## Installation
make sure you have a updated node and npm version
```
git clone https://github.com/ypan887/photo_gallary.git you_local_folder
cd your_local_folder
npm -i
npm start
```

Then visit http://localhost:8000/webpack-dev-server/ for development
